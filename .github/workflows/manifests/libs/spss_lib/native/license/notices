3. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its
time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175:
Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
7. Database Ownership
The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
on the database or the code. Any person making a contribution to the
database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
contribution or in the TZ Database.
