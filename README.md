# DataWiz - Research Data Documentation Assisstant
![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2020)


DataWiz helps Psychlogist with their research documentation. 
As web based system DataWiz is free to use by anyone and contributions are welcome.
More details of how to use DataWiz and how to contribute can be found at our homepage.

## State of this project

This is the second iteration of the DataWiz application.
For today, you can't use this code in production and changes will occur.

## Supported development environments

If you use `macos` or `ubuntu` you should have __no problems__, 
because those operating systems are used by the main contributors.
For those who wanna use `windows`, please consider running __Windows Subsystem For Linux__ (_WSL_).
While there is no intention to maintain any `windows` specific configuration from our side, 
you are still welcome to contribute and maintain those changes.

## Installation

To start developing you will need a local installation of `php`, `nodejs (and npm)`, `make` and the `symfony cli`.
With those in your `$PATH` you can run the following commands to see a running application:

```
make install # will setup everything for you
make run # applies all changes and starts a dev server

```
