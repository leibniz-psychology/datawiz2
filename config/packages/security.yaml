    # IMPORTANT: The processing in Symfony changed. This file is evaluated AFTER your env config
    # It will therefore override your configuration and completly mess up your authentication
    # Please, prevent any firewall config here

    # Easy way to control access for large sections of your site
    # Note: Only the *first* access control that matches will be used
