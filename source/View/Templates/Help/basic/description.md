### Description example

> Working memory is usually described as a system for the simultaneous remembering and processing of information. The "Memory Updating" task allows the demands of the two components - remembering and processing - to be incrementally varied independently from each other. We used a numerical version of this task to measure the capacity of working memory in young and old adults. To this end, we investigated working memory by manipulating the presentation time for individual calculations for each person using an individual time-accuracy functions task with increasing load on working memory (simultaneously remembering 1 to 6 digits). The results show that both the asymptotic-achieved accuracy, as well as the rate at which accuracy reaches the asymptote, increases with the memory load and with age. While several alternative mathematical models were used on the data, only two of them (one based on interference, one for time-dependent trace decay) yielded a satisfactory fit to the data. This data can be used as a benchmark dataset for formal models of working memory capacity.
