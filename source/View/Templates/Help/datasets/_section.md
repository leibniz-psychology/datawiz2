# Datasets help

You can upload one or more datasets belonging to your study.

## File structure

The research data must be represented as tabular data in flat rectangular files. Columns represent different variables, while rows represent different observations (e.g. subjects).

## File formats

Possible file formats are SPSS Statistics dataset (.sav) files [according to IBM, SPSS data files (.sav extension) are backward and forward compatible], Tab separated files (.tsv) and Comma separated files (.csv). DataWiz will import SPSS metadata (variable attributes) into its codebook. It will also read the variable names (headings) of .tsv or .csv files.
