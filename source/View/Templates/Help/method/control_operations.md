Which control operations did you use to limit the effects of participant variables (order and sequence effects)?

### Block randomization

Block randomization. A method for assigning study participants to experimental conditions in which individuals are arbitrarily divided into subsets or blocks and then some random process is used to place individuals from those blocks into the different conditions. For example, a researcher might divide participants into blocks of 10 and then randomly assign half of the people in each to the control group and half to the experimental group. Block randomization is distinct from blocking in that the block does not have any significance other than as an assignment unit.

### Complete counterbalancing (all possible orders)

Complete counterbalancing. A process of arranging a series of experimental conditions or treatments in such a way that every possible sequence of conditions is given at least once during the study. For instance, the following arrangement of sequences of three treatments (A, B, C), each assigned to a different subgroup of participants, demonstrates complete counterbalancing: A-B-C, A-C-B, B-C-A, B-A-C, C-A-B, and C-B-A.

### Incomplete counterbalancing (partial counterbalancing)

Incomplete counterbalancing. An experimental design that controls for order effects by using a limited number of possible sequences of treatments administered in such a way that each treatment appears equally often in each position. For instance, the following arrangement of sequences of three treatments (A, B, C), each assigned to a different subgroup of participants, demonstrates incomplete counterbalancing: A-B-C to Subgroup 1, B-C-A to Subgroup 2, and C-A-B to Subgroup 3. (also called partial counterbalancing).

### Latin Square

Latin square. A type of within-subjects design in which treatments, denoted by Latin letters, are administered in sequences that are systematically varied such that each treatment occurs equally often in each position of the sequence (first, second, third, etc.). The number of treatments administered must be the same as the number of groups or individual participants receiving them. For example, for an experimental design involving four treatments (A, B, C, and D) and four people, one person might receive Treatment A, then B, then C, and then D; a second person might receive them in sequence B, C, D, and A; a third person in sequence C, D, A, and B; and a fourth person in sequence D, A, B, and C. It is important to note that although Latin squares control for order effects they do not control for carryover effects or practice effects.

### Latin Square using a random starting order with rotation (rotate order)

Latin Square using a Random starting order with rotation. In this method, we randomly select an order for the top row, and then rotate the position of each condition by one placement in each subsequent row.

### Reverse counterbalancing (ABBA-counterbalancing)

Reverse counterbalancing. A specific procedure for ordering stimulus materials in a research study that involves administering one order (A-B-C) for one half of the participants and the opposite order (C-B-A) for the other half. Reverse counterbalancing is used to minimize any potential influence of presentation on results.
