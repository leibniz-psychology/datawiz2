Experimental manipulation (treatment, intervention)
: In an experiment, the manipulation of one or more independent variables (treatment variables) in order to investigate their effect on a dependent variable. An example would be the assignment of a specific treatment or placebo to participants in a research study in order to control possible confounds and assess the effect of the treatment.

Treatment
: The intervention to which some participants in an experimental design (the experimental group or treatment group) are exposed, in contrast to a control group, who do not receive the intervention. Also called treatment conditions.

Treatment variable
: The independent variable, whose effect on a dependent variable is studied in a research project.

Independent variable (IV)
: The variable in an experiment that is specifically manipulated or is observed to occur before the dependent, or outcome, variable, in order to assess its effect or influence. Independent variables may or may not be causally related to the dependent variable. In statistical analyses—such as path analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling—an independent variable is likely to be referred to as a causal variable, explanatory variable, or predictor variable. See also treatment in the APA Dictionary of Psychology.

### Example

> For example, in Darley and Latané's experiment, the independent variable was the number of witnesses that participants believed to be present. The researchers manipulated this independent variable by telling participants that there were either one, two, or five other students involved in the discussion, thereby creating three conditions.
