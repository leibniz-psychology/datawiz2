## About research design

A research design is a strategic plan of the procedures to be followed during a study in order to reach valid conclusions, with particular consideration given to participant selection and assignment to conditions, data collection, and data analysis. Research designs may take a variety of forms, including not only experiments but also quasi-experiments, observational studies, longitudinal designs, surveys, focus groups, and other nonexperimental methods.

### Experimental vs. non-experimental designs

**Experimental design** describes the way participants are allocated to experimental groups of an investigation.

**Non-experimental research** is usually descriptive or correlational, which means that you are either describing a situation or phenomenon simply as it stands, or you are describing a relationship between two or more variables, all without any interference from the researcher.

### Experimental designs

#### Random assignment

Random assignment refers to how chosen participants are assigned to experimental groups. Helpful source: [The Research Randomizer website](http://www.randomizer.org)

#### Random assignment example

> Imagine that a researcher is interested in learning whether or not drinking caffeinated beverages prior to an exam will improve test performance. After randomly selecting a pool of participants, each person is randomly assigned to either the control group or the experimental group. The participants in the control group consume a placebo drink prior to the exam that does not contain any caffeine. Those in the experimental group, on the other hand, consume a caffeinated beverage before taking the test. Participants in both groups then take the test, and the researcher compares the results to determine if the caffeinated beverage had any impact on test performance. (Kendra Cherry)

#### Non-random assignment

Quasi-experimental design: Subjects are assigned to groups based on non-random criteria. Many types of quasi-experimental designs exist. The most common types are nonequivalent groups design, regression discontinuity, and natural experiments.

#### Non-random assignment example

> You discover that a few of the psychotherapists in the clinic have decided to try out the new therapy, while others who treat similar patients have chosen to stick with the normal protocol. You can use these pre-existing groups to study the symptom progression of the patients treated with the new therapy versus those receiving the standard course of treatment. Although the groups were not randomly assigned, if you properly account for any systematic differences between them, you can be reasonably confident any differences must arise from the treatment and not other confounding variables. (Lauren Thomas)

#### Clinical trial

NIH Definition of a Clinical Trial: A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. See also Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).

#### Clinical trial example

> In a study by Vinnars et al. (2009), two treatments for personality disorder were compared. The experimental treatment was a manualized version of supportive-expressive psychotherapy (SEP), and the control condition was nonmanualized community-delivered psychodynamic treatment (CDPT). Thus, this was a simple one-factor between-subjects design with two experimental conditions.

### Non-experimental designs

#### Observational study

Observational research is a type of descriptive research that differs from most other forms of data gathering in that the researcher's goal is not to manipulate the variables being observed. While participants may or may not be aware of the researchers presence, the researchers do not try to control variables (as in an experiment), or ask participants to respond to direct questions (as in an interview or survey based study). Instead, the participants are simply observed in a natural setting, defined as a place in which behavior ordinarily occurs, rather than a place that has been arranged specifically for the purpose of observing the behavior.

#### Observational study example

> Jane Goodall's famous research on chimpanzees is a classic example of naturalistic observation. Dr. Goodall spent three decades observing chimpanzees in their natural environment in East Africa. She examined such things as chimpanzee's social structure, mating patterns, gender roles, family structure, and care of offspring by observing them in the wild. [Goodall, Jane (1966). Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees. (PhD thesis)]

#### Cohort study

A study design where one or more samples (called cohorts) are followed prospectively and subsequent status evaluations with respect to a disease or outcome are conducted to determine which initial participants exposure characteristics (risk factors) are associated with it. As the study is conducted, outcome from participants in each cohort is measured and relationships with specific characteristics determined

#### Cohort study example

> This prospective cohort study explored "the joint effects of sleep quality and sleep duration on the development of coronary heart disease." The study included 60,586 participants and an association was shown between increased risk of coronary heart disease and individuals who experienced short sleep duration and poor sleep quality. Long sleep duration did not demonstrate a significant association.

Journal Of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 14(1), 109-117. https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.6894]</div> -->

#### Case-control study

A study that compares patients who have a disease or outcome of interest (cases) with patients who do not have the disease or outcome (controls), and looks back retrospectively to compare how frequently the exposure to a risk factor is present in each group to determine the relationship between the risk factor and the disease. Case control studies are observational because no intervention is attempted and no attempt is made to alter the course of the disease. The goal is to retrospectively determine the exposure to the risk factor of interest from each of the two groups of individuals: cases and controls. These studies are designed to estimate odds. Case control studies are observational because no intervention is attempted and no attempt is made to alter the course of the disease. The goal is to retrospectively determine the exposure to the risk factor of interest from each of the two groups of individuals: cases and controls. These studies are designed to estimate odds.

#### Case-control study example

> This case-control study compared serum vitamin D levels in individuals who experience migraine headaches with their matched controls. Studied over a period of thirty days, individuals with higher levels of serum Vitamin D was associated with lower odds of migraine headache.

#### Cross-sectional study

A cross-sectional study involves looking at data from a population at one specific point in time. The participants in this type of study are selected based on particular variables of interest. Researchers record the information that is present in a population, but they do not manipulate variables. This type of research can be used to describe characteristics that exist in a community, but not to determine cause-and-effect relationships between different variables. See "How Does the Cross-Sectional Research Method Work?"

#### Cross-sectional study example

> Researchers may find that people who reported engaging in certain health behaviors were also more likely to be diagnosed with specific ailments. While a cross-sectional study cannot prove for certain that these behaviors caused the condition, such studies can point to a relationship worth investigating further.

#### Survey research

Similar to an interview, a survey may use close-ended questions, open-ended questions, or a combination of the two. "Closed-ended questions" are questions that limit the person taking the survey to choose from a set of responses. Multiple choice, check all that apply, and ratings scale questions are all examples of closed-ended questions. "Open-ended questions" are simply questions that allow people to write in their own response.

#### Survey research example

> The National Comorbidity Survey is a large-scale mental health survey conducted in the United States (see http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs). In just one part of this survey, nearly 10,000 adults were given a structured mental health interview in their homes in 2002 and 2003. Results include information on the lifetime prevalence of some anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. (Lifetime prevalence is the percentage of the population that develops the problem sometime in their lifetime.) Obviously, this kind of information can be of great use both to basic researchers seeking to understand the causes and correlates of mental disorders as well as to clinicians and policymakers who need to understand exactly how common these disorders are.

#### Correlational research

In a correlational study, the researchers observe the participants, ask them questions, or collect records on them from archives. The data gathered are then correlated with one another (or are subjected to complex data analyses, discussed in Chapter 5) to see how they relate to one another. Again, the key is that the data are collected under the most naturalistic circumstances possible, with no experimental manipulation.

#### Correlational research example

> You want to know if wealthy people are less likely to be patient. From your experience, you believe that wealthy people are impatient. However, you want to establish a statistical pattern that proves or disproves your belief. In this case, you can carry out correlational research to identify a trend that links both variables.

#### Causal-comparative research

A causal-comparative design (ex post facto design) is a research design that seeks to find relationships between independent and dependent variables after an action or event has already occurred. The researcher's goal is to determine whether the independent variable affected the outcome, or dependent variable, by comparing two or more groups of individuals. Causal-comparative studies’ purpose is to identify the cause and effect relationships between the variables.

#### Causal-comparative research example

> A researcher identifies a dependent variable, such as high dropout rates in high schools. The next step is to explore reasons the dependent variable has occurred or is occurring. In this example, several issues may affect dropout rates, including such elements as parental support, socioeconomic level, gender, ethnicity, and teacher support. The researcher will need to select which issue is of importance to his or her research goals. One hypothesis might be, "Students from lower socioeconomic levels drop out of high school at higher rates than students from higher socioeconomic levels." Thus, the independent variable in this scenario would be socioeconomic levels of high school students. (Encyclopedia of Research Design)

#### Single case

An article that describes and interprets an individual case, often written in the form of a detailed story. Case reports often describe: Unique cases that cannot be explained by known diseases or syndromes; Cases that show an important variation of a disease or condition; Cases that show unexpected events that may yield new or useful information; Cases in which one patient has two or more unexpected diseases or disorders; Case reports are considered the lowest level of evidence, but they are also the first line of evidence, because they are where new issues and ideas emerge. This is why they form the base of our pyramid. A good case report will be clear about the importance of the observation being reported. If multiple case reports show something similar, the next step might be a case-control study to determine if there is a relationship between the relevant variables.

#### Single case example

> This case report is written by the patient, a physician who contracted SARS, and his colleague who treated him, during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. They describe how the disease progressed in Dr. Wu and based on Dr. Wu's case, advised that a chest CT showed hidden pneumonic changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.
