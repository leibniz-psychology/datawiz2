## About setting

Setting
: Setting is an environment or surrounding in which an event (a study) takes place. It may provide particular information about placement and timing, such as Paris, France, in the year 1789. Setting could be simply descriptive, like a lonely cottage on a mountain. Social conditions, historical time, geographical locations, weather, immediate surroundings, and timing are all different aspects of setting. In psychology, one distinguishes between artificial, real-life and natural settings.

### Artificial setting

In artificial settings like laboratories extraneous variables such as noise, temperature, light, seating arrangements, etc can be kept constant for all participants.

#### Artificial setting example

> Subjects, recruited from the student body of the University of Houston, College of Optometry, were seated in front of the instrument with their head stabilized in a chin rest and forehead strap. Room illumination was dimmed.

### Real-life setting

Real-life settings are more naturalistic but researchers still have control of the independent variables.

#### Real-life setting example

> During the (medical examination) preparation process, all students experienced the same events. Every weekday, all participating students studied in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. On Fridays, the students took a mock examination in their usual classroom. The psychological anxiety and perceived stress levels of the students were also evaluated on day 1, at 2 days before the official examination and at 10-15 days after the results were published.

Acute and chronic stress increase salivary cortisol: a study in the real-life setting of a national examination undertaken by medical graduates. Stress. 2014;17:149-56.]</div> -->

### Natural setting

Natural settings are the most realistic way of researching human behaviour in everyday life as participants are in their natural environment. Researchers have no control of the independent variables and must instead select ones that happen to naturally occur in the environment.

#### Natural setting example

> The Appalachian National Scenic Trail (AT) stretches 2168 miles over fourteen different states along the eastern region of the United States. Data were users of the AT over the summer and fall of 1999. Sampling occurred along the entire length of the trail. A stratified sampling technique was employed to obtain a representative sample of all AT hikers. To accomplish this, the length of the trail was segmented into 22 sections basedon use estimates provided by the various associations chargedwith maintaining the trail.
