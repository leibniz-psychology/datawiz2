### About setting

Setting
: Setting is an environment or surrounding in which an event (a study) takes place. It may provide particular information about placement and timing, such as Paris, France, in the year 1789. Setting could be simply descriptive, like a lonely cottage on a mountain. Social conditions, historical time, geographical locations, weather, immediate surroundings, and timing are all different aspects of setting. In psychology, one distinguishes between artificial, real-life and natural settings.
