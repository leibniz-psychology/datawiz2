# Materials help

Supplementary information is material that helps understanding how you carried out your research and evaluating your scientific claims. Materials can be publications (pre- or post-prints), reports, lab books, stimuli, computer code, data management plans, ethics approval forms, consent forms, pre-registration documents, multimedia files or anything that helps to understand your study.

It is considered good practice of scientific research to be as open and transparent as possible. Open science not only means making data and publications accessible to the community but also the methodologies and workflows. DataWiz supports a high level of research transparency in that you can bundle your research data, its documentation and the supplemental materials into a file that can be imported by public research repositories like PsychArchives.
