Sampling is the process of selecting individuals (observations, cases) from a population of specific interest.

### Convenience sampling

Convenience sampling is any process for selecting a sample of individuals or cases that is neither random nor systematic but rather is governed by chance or ready availability. Interviewing the first 50 people to exit a store is an example of convenience sampling. Data obtained from convenience sampling do not generalize to the larger population; there may be significant sampling bias, and sampling error cannot be estimated. Also called accidental sampling; opportunity sampling. (APA Dictionary) Convenience sampling is by far the most common non-probability sampling strategy: It is cheap, efficient, and simple to implement.

#### Example

> One of the most common examples of convenience sampling in psychology is the use of student volunteers as study participants. Recommendation for further reading: Bornstein MH, Jager J, Putnick DL.

### Random sampling

(Simple) random sampling is the most basic approach to drawing a random sample of cases, observations, or individuals from a population, in which the cases are selected individually using a fair process, such as the toss of a coin or a table of random digits. Also called independent random sampling or r representative sampling. (APA Dictionary) Probability sampling strategies yield an unbiased sample that is representative of the target population; however, probability samples can be cost-prohibitive.

#### Example

> Random sampling for a TV violence study. Our first step is to define the population. We might begin by considering the population as all children in the United States that are 5-15 years old. Our next step will be to obtain an exhaustive list of these children. Using U. S. Census data would be one approach. The third step is to select a random sample. The simplest technique would be to use a database of the population and instruct the database software to randomly select children from the population. The number to be selected is determined by the researcher and is typically based on the largest number that can be sampled given the logistical resources of the researcher. The larger the sample, the more accurately it will represent the population. After the sample is selected from the population, the final step is to contact the parents of these children to obtain consent to participate.

### Systematic sampling (quasirandom sampling)

Systematic sampling is a type of sampling process in which all the members of a population are listed and then some objective, orderly procedure is applied to randomly choose specific cases. For example, the population might be listed alphabetically and every seventh case selected. Also called quasirandom sampling; systematic random sampling. (APA Dictionary)

#### Example

> Suppose a supermarket wants to study buying habits of their customers, then using systematic sampling they can choose every 10th or 15th customer entering the supermarket and conduct the study on this sample. This is random sampling with a system. From the sampling frame, a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter are at regular intervals. (Wikipedia "Systematic sampling")

### Quota sampling

Quota sampling is a method of forming a sample in which a prespecified number of individuals with certain background characteristics, such as a particular age, race, ethnicity, sex, or education, are selected for inclusion. Often, participants are recruited as they arrive; once the quota for a given demographic group is filled, the researcher stops recruiting subjects from that group. A researcher who uses this approach can obtain a final study sample that has the same proportional characteristics as the target population, enabling statistical testing to be performed on a subset of cases that is appropriately representative of the larger group of interest. (APA Dictionary) Quota sampling is the non probability version of stratified sampling.

#### Example

> The UK adult population aged 18+ years was the target population for the COVID‐19 psychological research consortium (C19PRC) study. A longitudinal, internet panel survey was designed to assess: (1) COVID‐19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the public's response to the pandemic. Quota sampling (age, sex, and household income) was used to recruit a nationally representative sample of adults.

### Other sampling methods

There are many more sampling methods than those listed. If your method is not included, please type it in the appropriate field. Other methods could be, for example: self-selected sampling (volunteer sampling), cohort sampling, diversity sampling, experience sampling (event sampling, diary study), prospective sampling, retrospective sampling, theoretical sampling, clustered sampling, purposive sampling (judgement sampling), snowball sampling, etc.
