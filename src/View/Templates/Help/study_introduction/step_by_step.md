Follow these steps to make your data understandable, discoverable, citable and reusable.

1. **Describe your study** including basic information as well as research study level documentation

- The **Resource description** on your study enables other researchers to find and cite your data
- The **Study goals** part helps explain the aims of the study
- **Study method** is all about how your study was carried out
- In **Data collection**, you'll describe how you gathered the information on your variables of interest. Which measures and which equipment did you use?
- In **Sampling**, you'll provide information about your study's sample.

Together with the documentation of your datasets it helps someone not familiar with the data understand, and use the data.

2. **Upload and describe datasets** and codebooks. The datasets documentation describes what the entries in your data matrix mean. It is sometimes called a codebook or a data-dictionary. It explains the variables used in your study, such as the names given to variables, how they were defined, and their possible response options. If your data is in proprietary format, DataWiz will convert it to a sustainable (open) format.
3. **Upload materials** The more information you provide, the better others can understand your data. Supplementary documentation that can be associated with datasets helps to facilitate data reuse. You can upload any kind of supplementary materials like associated analyses, or experimental-control data.
4. **Review input** to check the documentation you provided. Share an overview of your documentation with fellow researchers to get feedback.
5. Finally, **Export** your data its documentation and the related materials as a ZIP file.
