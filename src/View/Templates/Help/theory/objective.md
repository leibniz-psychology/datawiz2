Your aims answer the question, 'What are you doing?' The objectives are the answer to the question, 'How are you doing it?' Your objectives should be stated using action verbs that are specific enough to be measured, for example: to compare, to calculate, to assess, to test, to determine, to verify, to calculate, to describe, to explain, and so forth.

### Example

> The general aim of this research is to differentiate moral obligation from moral norms and moral conviction, as well as to compare their ability to predict collective action. In order to do so, the research objectives are: (a) conceptualize and operationalize moral obligation (Study 1, N = 171); (b) test its predictive power for intention to participate in protests (Study 2, N = 622); and (c) test moral obligation in a real context (Study 3, N = 407).
