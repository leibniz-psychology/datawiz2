      intro: "DataWiz will guide you through a few short **steps** to describe your study and its research data so others can find, understand, and reuse it more easily. The result is a **ZIP file** that you can upload to a data repository.\n\nYou can **navigate** the steps using the sidebar ðŸ‘ˆ on the left or use the buttons at the bottom of each page to move forward or back.\n\nIf you need **help** with any input field, you'll find more info in the sidebar ðŸ‘‰ on the right - just click the #helpBtn# button.\n\nThere's a brief summary of each step below, or you can jump right in: #startBtn#"
      steps: "## Summary of steps\n\n1. In step 1, **Describe your study**, you'll document information _about_ the study and the research data itself. We'll ask you about **basic information** (title, description, associated articles, and people that contributed to the study and to data collection), **goals** and hypotheses of the study, the study's research **method** (experimental, observational etc.), how the **data were collected**, and finally, in **Sampling**, about the study's subjects and how they were chosen.\n2. In **Upload and describe datasets** you'll do just that, so _be sure to have your research data files ready._ You'll be able to create a **codebook** to describe the variables and values in your data matrix. (If your data is in SPSS format, DataWiz will convert it into a sustainable, open CSV format, but will also save a copy of the original file.)\n3. In **Upload materials** you can add any supplementary materials that may help to understand and replicate the study. **Examples:** associated analyses and analysis software code; forms, questionnaires, or stimulus material presented to particpants.\n4. In **Review input** you'll find a one-page overview of the information you entered in the previous steps, so you can make sure everything is in order before exporting.\n5. Finally, you'll be able to **Export** a ZIP file that includes you documentation and codebook (in XML and JSON format), the research data itself (original files and csv versions), and copies of any related materials."
